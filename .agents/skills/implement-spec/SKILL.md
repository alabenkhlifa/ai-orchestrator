description: Implement and verify one approved Spec-Driven Development slice from requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md. Use when a user asks to build an approved feature slice, continue its active tasks, or complete its verification gate while preserving scope, stop conditions, progress logs, and specification write-back.

# Implement Spec

Implement only the active approved slice and preserve the agreement around it.

## Preconditions

Confirm that expected behavior, design decisions, implementation boundary, task ownership, proof, and project checks are clear. Stop and use `update-spec` when a decision blocks active implementation or required verification, or when a required delivery surface is unmapped or ambiguously owned. A later deployment or release gate is not an implementation stop condition unless the requested work would cross that gate.

## Workflow

1. Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` and all three feature specification files.
2. Inspect relevant existing code and confirm ownership boundaries.
3. Preflight delivery coverage: inventory every UI, API, domain, persistence, integration, security or privacy, and operational surface named by the active-slice requirements and design, then confirm that each has one primary task through `Owned surfaces`.
4. Stop and use `update-spec` if any required surface is unmapped or ambiguously owned. A browser check or other proof does not imply ownership of the implementation, and a final end-to-end task must not hide otherwise unassigned pages or behavior.
5. Confirm that unresolved items name the stage they block. Keep explicit deployment-only gates visible without treating them as active implementation blockers.
6. Preflight environment readiness: confirm the external dependencies, services, runtimes, and credentials the task proofs require are available. When one is unavailable, treat it as an environment blocker, not an implementation defect: pause only the affected proofs, continue independent work, surface it to the user, and record it in `tasks.md` as environment-blocked.
7. Mark the active task `In Progress`.
8. Implement one task at a time and run its attached proof. Check each proof's real exit status; do not trust output piped through `tail`, `head`, or `grep`, which mask the command's exit code, and re-run any ambiguous result before recording pass or fail. Record a multi-command proof per sub-proof, distinguishing passed from environment-blocked, and mark a task complete only when every sub-proof passes.
9. Write progress, failures, discoveries, and deferred work into `tasks.md` as state changes.
10. Stop and use `update-spec` when behavior, design, scope, ownership, or blocker classification must change.
11. Run the complete verification gate.
12. Mark the slice `Verified` only when every required check passes, and report release readiness separately.

## Stop Conditions

Stop when work expands beyond the approved boundary, a missing decision affects behavior or architecture required by the active slice, a required delivery surface lacks one clear owning task, implementation conflicts with the specification, a required check fails outside the slice, or ownership overlaps another task or agent.

Do not stop implementation only because a recorded deployment or release gate remains incomplete. Do stop before deploying, releasing, or claiming release readiness while that gate remains incomplete.

An unavailable environment dependency, such as a stopped service, missing daemon, or absent credential, is an environment blocker, not an implementation defect. Pause the affected proofs, continue independent work, surface it to the user, and record it as environment-blocked. Verify evidence by real exit status and re-run ambiguous results; do not record a masked or piped exit code as a pass.

Use sub-agents only when work separates cleanly by ownership, files, and proof. Reconcile all results and run final verification in one place.

## Boundaries

- Do not implement unapproved scope.
- Do not change acceptance criteria to fit code.
- Do not treat proof as ownership of implementation.
- Do not hide failing checks or unresolved decisions.
- Do not record a proof as passing without a verified real exit status, and do not stage another agent's concurrent changes.
- Do not mark work complete without its proof.
- Do not describe verified implementation as deployable or releasable unless its release gates also pass.

## Completion

Finish when approved behavior works, required checks pass, the specification files reflect the final implementation state, and any remaining release gate is reported explicitly.
